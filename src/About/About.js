            <p>My work experiences have varied greatly: from the non-profit sector to the service industry, from education to my most current role as creative director for a rock-and-roll band. The common threads that weave through all of my professional experiences are creativity and innovation. Whether I am creating a teaching strategy, an app or a t-shirt design, I am always looking to improve upon prior work and present the project in an engaging and professional way. I strive to communicate directly and honestly, work efficiently, and push for female representation in historically male-dominated fields.</p>
